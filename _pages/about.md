I have proven abilities to work under pressure where quick learning and ready-witted problem-solving capabilities are my driving forces. I have recently completed my master’s degree in computer science. I also have a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering. Besides, I worked for leading telecommunication companies in Asia - Robi Axiata Limited and Grameenphone Limited which serve more than 49 million and 83 million subscribers respectively. With my considerable technical and interpersonal skills, I am always open to new challenges and newer opportunities.
