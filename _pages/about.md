I have proven abilities to work under pressure where quick learning and ready-witted problem-solving capabilities are my driving forces. I have recently completed my master’s degree in computer science. I also have a bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering. Besides, I worked for leading telecommunication companies in Asia such as Robi Axiata Limited and Grameenphone Limited which serve more than 49 million and 83 million subscribers respectively. With my considerable technical and interpersonal skills, I am always open to new challenges and newer opportunities.

I am looking for opportunities to start a PhD in Computer Science. My research interests include but are not limited to Data Management, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Software Engineering.
